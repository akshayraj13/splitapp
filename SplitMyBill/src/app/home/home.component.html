      <p>
        SplitMyBill is a Providence, RI based company that makes it easy
        to split bills with friends and family. We organize all your shared
        expenses and IOUs in one place, so that everyone can see who they owe.
        Whether you are sharing a ski vacation, splitting rent with roommates,
        or owe someone for lunch, Splitwise makes life easier. We store data “in
        the cloud,” so that you can access it anywhere: on iPhone, Android, or
        on your computer.

      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px">We focus on fairness</h2>
      <p>
        Most people want to be fair to each other, but sometimes they
        forget, or can’t decide on what fair is. In addition to helping people
        honor their debts, we provide mediation advice about fairness issues
        through our “fairness calculators.” These calculators turn our
        crowdsourced data into a neutral fairness opinion about your personal
        situation.
